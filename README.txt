Assignment 4: Registrar’s Office Simulation



Source Files:

OfficeSimulation.cpp
Simulation.cpp
Window.cpp
Student.cpp
Queue.cpp
DoubleLinkedList.cpp
ListNode.cpp



Notes:

When counting time, I made what I believe is the correct assumption that each segment of Time represents its own entire minute, such that a window occupied from Time 0 through Time 11 represents a total of 12 minutes. Minute 0, minute 1, . . ., minute 11.

In the input file, there may not be any blank lines.

Rao helped me understand how to chain together multiple classes that use the same template class.
